pioneer-assets
==============

Asset source collection for the Pioneer space simuation.
This repository stores the high-level files used in the creation of the artwork
— models, soundtrack, icons... With it are provided instructions to build the
usable files — .obj, .ogg, .png files.

How to contribute
-----------------

Well, first, get your contribution within Pioneer itself. Then, either open a
Pull Request adding the models to the repository, Makefile included, or
subscribe to the pioneer dev mailing list at http://pioneerspacesim.net/list if
not done already, and write there an email with a link to the data and a
description of how you build the final product.

The infrastructure is still a work in progress ;-)
